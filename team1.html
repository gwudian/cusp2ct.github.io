			<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/odedina-folakemi-t-ph-d/bio-20516377" target="_blank">Dr. Folakemi T. Odedina </a>is the Assoc. Director for the Center for Health Equity and Community Engagement Research (CHCR), site Director of CHCR Florida, and Director of Global Health Equity Program at Mayo Clinic. 
			Dr. Odedina is an internationally recognized cancer researcher and academic leader. She has led global research programs for decades, primarily funded by the National Cancer Institute and the Department of Defense. This research focuses on developing cost-effective, community-based behavioral intervention programs to address prostate cancer in Black males.
			Her research, education, training and community outreach activities have exclusively focused on addressing health disparities in racial and ethnic minority and underserved communities. As a behavioral scientist, she conducts behavioral research across the translational continuum to test behavioral models, confirm who will benefit from behavioral interventions and examine how to deliver interventions in all settings.
			</p>
			
			<p class="text">
			Dr. Odedina's research program has developed and validated multiple behavioral models that include multilevel assessment of barriers and facilitators for the uptake of interventions, tested and adapted interventions that include behavioral clinical trials, and worked closely with community health workers to implement health intervention programs in diverse community settings worldwide.
			She has also been a leader in training future scientists whose backgrounds are underrepresented in biomedical research.

			<h3>Dr. Qian Shi</h3>
            <p class="text">
			<img class="image image-wrap-text-2" src="img/shi.jpg">
			<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/shi-qian-ph-d/bio-00096527" target="_blank">Dr. Qian Shi</a> is the Assoc. Director of Quantitative Science and Director of Biostatistics Core of MCCC. The primary research interests of  Dr. Shi are in the area of the conduct and methodology of clinical trials in cancer. Dr. Shi works to develop innovative statistical study design to run more efficient clinical trials that deliver effective, novel treatments to patients with cancer. 
			Additional areas of active research include evaluation and methodology of surrogate endpoints, meta-analyses of individual patient data from a large collection of clinical trials, survival analysis, and prognostic and predictive biomarker analysis. 
			The research conducted by Dr. Shi contributes to an increased understanding of tumor genetics and patient factors that make disease more or less aggressive, and provides innovations in conducting oncology clinical trials. When successful, the clinical trials that Dr. Shi participates in directly contribute to new treatment options for patients with cancer..
