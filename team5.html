			<h2>Univ. Florida and Univ. Miami - ALEX (Agent Leveraging Empathy for eXams) - vCHEs</h2>
			<p class="text">
              Our site in The University of Florida and The University of Miami will increase referral to cancer clinical trials (CCTs) among minority patients across the Florida by adapting and evaluating the ALEX Portal: a novel patient decision and navigation aid using Virtual Human Technology. 
			</p>
			
			<h3>Our goals include:</h3>			
			  
			<p class="text">
			(1)Assess clinician, CHE, and self-referrals to existing CCTs in Florida</p>
			<p class="text">
			(2)Develop the ALEX Portal: a scalable vCHE intervention for navigating racial and ethnic minority patients to recurring CCTs at participating Florida cancer centers</p>
			<p class="text">
			(3)Launch the ALEX Portal via OneFlorida+ to evaluate sustainability</p>
