			<h2>Moffitt Cancer Center - Trial Connect Portal CHEs</h2>
			<p class="text">
              Our site in Moffitt Cancer Center will develop and implement a multi-level intervention designed to increase referral and recruitment of Black and Hispanic cancer patients to NCI-sponsored therapeutic clinical trials (CTs). 
			  The ACT WONDER2S intervention will be delivered through community health educator (CHE) led outreach and navigation coupled with digital interventions for the community resident, community physician, cancer center patient, and cancer center physician.</p>
			<h3>Our goals include:</h3>	
				<p class="text">
				(1)Refine and finalize the ACT WONDER2S intervention components using an iterative approach based on Learner Verification (LV) and User Centered Design (UCD).</p>
				<p class="text">
				(2)Implement and evaluate the impact of ACT WONDER2S on racial/ethnic minority patient referral and enrollment on NCI-sponsored therapeutic CTs using a historical control design.</p>
				<p class="text">
				(3)Assess implementation outcomes and identify barriers and facilitators of ACT WONDER2S using mixed methods with each stakeholder group at key time points to inform modifications and future areas of improvement.</p>
