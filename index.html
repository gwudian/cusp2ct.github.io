The Connecting Underrepresented Populations to Clinical Trials (CUSP2CT) program will implement and evaluate multilevel and culturally tailored outreach and education interventions with the primary goal of increasing referral and ultimately, 
accrual of underrepresented racial/ethnic (R/E) minority populations, to NCI-supported clinical trials (CTs) (National Clinical Trial Network (NCTN), NCI's Community Oncology Research Program (NCORP), 
and Experimental Therapeutics Clinical Trials Network (ETCTN)). These programs' target population(s) will include individuals from underrepresented racial/ethnic minority populations and will address cancer health disparities through a network of local multidisciplinary and integrated partners.
Without adequate representation, especially in therapeutic trials, cancer disparities are likely to increase as R/E populations may not be able to fully benefit from cutting-edge treatments and the promises of precision medicine.

            <h3>Project Summary​</h3>
            <p class="text">
Despite the decline in overall mortality and incidence of cancer in the US population, 
disparities in cancer care still largely exist within certain groups. 
One key barrier causing the lack of proportional representation of these groups is the lack of dedicated efforts employing scientific rigorous approaches and implementation strategies for increasing their proportional representation in clinical trials. 
The Connecting Underrepresented Populations to Clinical Trials (CUSP2CT) program aims to implement and evaluate multilevel and culturally tailored outreach and education interventions that will increase the accrual of underrepresented populations in clinical trials. 
To support the CUSP2CT program, we are proposing to be the Data, Evaluation, and Coordination Center (DECC) to support the data and evaluation activities and coordinate a learning collaborative towards mitigating the key barriers of cancer disparity. 
Specifically, we will collaborate with the CUSP2CT U01 investigators and interact with involved NCI staff members and with other stakeholders, as needed, to carry out the following activities: 1) establish effective and efficient administrative processes and infrastructure through scientific leadership, 
organizational processes, governance structure, effective oversight and operational procedures to achieve optimal communication, collaboration, coordination, and dissemination of the CUSP2CT research, 
2) facilitate and coordinate data collection and management across the CUSP2CT program to facilitate evidence generation and rapid dissemination of methods and tools, 3) organize and facilitate collaborative efforts on program evaluation, engagement, and communication, and 4) foster a learning collaborative in leading and coordinating trans-CUSP2CT research.

We are uniquely positioned to be the DECC for CUSP2T leveraging strong track record in: 
(i) implementing health equity centers and consortia (e.g. Dr. Odedina is MPI on NCI CRCHD U54 CaRE2 Health Equity Center and contact MPI for a newly awarded Department of Defense iCCaRE for Black Men Consortium); 
(ii) leading statistics and data management coordinating center effort in cancer trials (e.g., Mayo is the Statistics and Data Management Center of the Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology (Alliance) including both interventional and NCORP grants); 
(iii) leading standardization and interoperability for practice and research (e.g., Mayo has been contributing to the NCI Terminology Service Development Effort and part of the data harmonization efforts in the NCATS Clinical Data to Health (CD2H)). 
Additionally, we have strong institutional priorities aligning with CUSP2CT with existing infrastructure and resources supporting the CUSP2CT mission.
